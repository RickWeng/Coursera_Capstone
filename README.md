## Abstract

## Introduction
Vancouver has one of the highest concentrations of Chinese people outside the continent of Asia. Chinese account for nearly 28% of the population (Statistics Canada, 2011), which leads to emerging Chinese restaurants over the past decade. The number of Chinese population in Vancouver is likely to continue to grow at a faster rate than the non-Chinese population (Statistics Canada, 2016). An accelerating rise of Chinese restaurants can be expected. Now is a good time for investors to open a Chinese restaurant, the real problem is what is the optimal location?  
Location is important for the success of restaurant because it affects the cost and competition. Locations with high density of population but low density of restaurants in the vicinity are likely to attract more customers. Most restaurant location selection analyses in Vancouver cover rent cost, yet very few address or seriously recognize competition. To address these knowledge gaps, I conduct an assessment of Chinese population and restaurant distribution across the City of Vancouver. Local areas are then segmented and clustered accordingly. I assume major customers of Chinese restaurants are Chinese. I pose three questions:
1. How is Chinese population distributed in the City of Vancouver?
2. How are Chinese restaurants distributed in the City of Vancouver?
3. Which local area in the City of Vancouver should the investor open a Chinese restaurant? 
This study is aimed at providing location insights for investors interested in opening a Chinese restaurant in the City of Vancouver.   
## Method
Local Area Boundary shape area, 2016 Census of Population number of Chinese population, density of Chinese population  
Local Area Boundary shape area, centroid, Foursquare API, density of restaurants    
Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), optimal chinese restaurant location   
### Data
**Local Area Boundary**  
Local Area Boundary (City of Vancouver, 2019) contains the polygons for the cityâ€™s 22 local areas (also known as local planning areas). These boundaries generally follow street centrelines. Shape area can be calculated. Centroid as the arithmetic mean position of the polygon were also derived for further analysis.  
**2016 Census of Population**  
The 2016 Census (Statistics Canada, 2016) provides statistical information about the population. Visible minority for the population in private households was used to assess the number of Chinese population in each of the city's 22 Local Areas. Visible minorities refer to persons, other than Aboriginal peoples, who are non-Caucasian in race or non-white in colour. The visible minority population consists many groups such as Chinese, Black, Latin American and Arab. The density of Chinese population in each local area can be then calculated.  
**Foursquare API**  
Foursquare builds a massive dataset of location data. Using Foursquare API and centroid coordinates, I can extract spatial and category information about nearby venues of each local area (Foursquare, 2019). To get the number of Chinese restaurants in each local area, I searched Chinese restaurants(id) specifically. The density of Chinese restaurants in each local area can then be calculated. Foursquare API also allows me to extract rating (0-10) for each restaurant. However, ratings in this study were only used to 
### Cluster Analysis
DBSCAN is a popular unsupervised clustering algorithm that is commonly used in machine learning (Ester et al., 1996). DBSCAN groups similar points that are close to each other based on a radius and a minimum number of points. Unlike K-means, DBSCAN can identify clusters of arbitrary shape and find outliers without specifying the number of clusters before the clustering process. DBSCAN was used to segment and cluster local areas in the study.
