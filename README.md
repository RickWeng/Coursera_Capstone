## Introduction
Business problem: Which neighborhood in the City of Vancouver should the investor open a chinese restaurant?
Chinese account for nearly 27% of the population. Chinese restaurants have been emerging over the past decade. 
An accelerating rise of chinese-oriented restaurants can be expected. 
These cultural analysts foresee an accelerating rise of Asian-oriented restaurants, retail outlets, artistic events, religions, community service organizations, schools, neighbourhood enclaves, family-reunification programs, signage, international business partnerships, corporate customs and Asian-language newspapers and TV stations.
Forty-three per cent of Metro Vancouver residents have an Asian heritage, which is a much higher proportion than any other major city outside the continent of Asia.
Based on Statistics Canada reports, the number of those with Asian roots in Metro Vancouver will continue to grow at a faster rate than the non-Asian population.
Around the globe, the only major cities outside Asia {* with more than 1.2 million residents} that come close to Metro Vancouver for their portion of residents with Asian backgrounds are San Francisco (33 per cent Asian), London, England (21 per cent), Metro Toronto (35 per cent), Calgary (23 per cent) and Sydney, Australia (19 per cent).
